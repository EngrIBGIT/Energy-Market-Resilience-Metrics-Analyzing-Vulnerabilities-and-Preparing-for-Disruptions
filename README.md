- Visualization of the Market Price from the market dataset alongside the Energy Price from the historical energy dataset over time

![](Expl_5MET.PNG)

#### Observation:
From the plot:
- Market Price: Average price based on market forces
- Energy Price : Average price which energix is selling.
- There is no consistency in price as Prices are fluctuating.
- Energix prices are lower compared to conventonal market prices
- Probable reason Energix have a high spike in demand is due to lower prices.
- A need to look more into the analysis

### C. Energy Demand and Energy Price Correlation:
- Checking the influence of energy demand by the current energy price

#### i. Infrastructure Status and Technology Limitations
- Understanding the state of infrastructure over time
- To visualize the frequency of various infrastructure Status and the distribution of Technology Limitations from 
  Infrastructure_data.
- 
![](Expl_6ITL.PNG)

#### Observations:
From the plots:
- Infrastructure Is categorized into:
  - _Good:_ Less Frequent almost non-existent
  - _Fair:_ Follows Poor status
  - _Poor:_ Very Prevalent
This indicates reason why energix is unable to meet up with demands probably due to the kind of available infrastructure, hence need for a more proactive maintenance approach to infrastructure:

**While:**
- Technology Limitations is categorized into:
 - _High:_ Data reveals technology limitation is very high followed by
 - _Moderate:_ being average
 - _Low:_ Almost non existent use of technology.
   Suggest hampering operational effectiveness and ability to market properly due to technology limitations.

#### ii. Infrastructure Status Relationship with Technology Limitations:
-To see how they both correlate, to help see a reason behind energix inability to meet up market with demand of products.

![](Expl_7ITL.PNG)

### Observations:
From the Heatmap plot the following assumptions are made;
- There is a strong correlation between poor Infrastructure Status and high Technology Limitations as it affect 
   the inability of energix to meet market demand
- Hence for poor Infrastructure Status implies high Technology Limitations
- There is a need for upgrade and total overhaul of energix infrastructure, improve technology uage inorder to increase production to meet market demands.

##### Justifying Assumptions:
- The correlation between poor infrastructure and high technology limitation and the energy production will guide the justification;

![](just_asmp.PNG)

### General Insights:
1. __Dynamic Energy Landscape:__ Energix Enterprise experiences marked variances in energy production, consumption, and demand patterns. There are distinct periods where the demand overshadows production, highlighting potential areas of concern in market stability and supply consistency.

2. __Pricing Volatility:__ Energix's energy pricing exhibits variability in alignment with broader market price trends. Notably, the energy price remains uncorrelated with energy demand, presenting potential challenges in sales predictability and revenue forecasting.

3. __Infrastructure & Technology Concerns:__ A significant portion of the company's infrastructure is categorized as 'Poor'. Coupled with pronounced technology limitations, there's a compelling case for comprehensive infrastructure rejuvenation. Preliminary analysis suggests that periods of 'Poor' infrastructure status and 'High' technology constraints may correlate with diminished energy production.

4. __Regulatory & Financial Implications:__ Energix is continually navigating a changing regulatory landscape, with new mandates and modifications to existing ones. The financial ramifications, especially in terms of compliance costs and operational expenditures, are substantial. A juxtaposition of these costs with the firm's current revenue trajectory indicates a pressing profitability challenge.

5. __Emergence of Renewables:__ The energy market is witnessing a paradigm shift with renewables gaining prominence. Data trends suggest instances where renewable energy production has eclipsed that of fossil fuels. For Energix, this underscores the dual challenges of evolving competition and potential erosion of market share.

### Resilience Planning and Recommendations

1. **Balanced Energy Portfolio**: Energix Enterprise should consider diversifying its energy production portfolio to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in demand and production. A balanced mix of renewable and non-renewable sources can help stabilize the energy supply and meet demand more consistently.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Given that energy price doesn't correlate with energy demand, Energix should consider implementing a dynamic pricing model. This model can adjust prices based on demand, production costs, and other market factors. Such a model can help in improving sales during high-demand periods and maintaining profitability during low-demand times.

3. **Infrastructure Revamp**: With most of the company's infrastructure in 'Poor' status and high technology limitations, Energix should prioritize investments in infrastructure upgrades. Modernizing infrastructure can lead to increased production efficiency, reduced downtimes, and potentially higher energy output.

4. **Regulatory Compliance Fund and Operational Cost**: Given the periodic introduction of new regulations and the associated compliance costs and also operational cost. Energix should establish a dedicated fund or reserve to address these unforeseen expenses. This approach can help in budgeting and ensuring that costs don't significantly impact the company's bottom line.

5. **Embrace Renewables**: The trend towards renewable energy is evident. Energix should consider increasing its investments in renewable energy technologies and infrastructure. This not only aligns with global sustainability goals but also positions the company to better compete in an evolving energy market.

6. **Cost Management & Revenue Generation**: Considering the operational and compliance costs are impacting profitability, Energix should undertake a thorough review of its operations to identify cost-saving opportunities. Additionally, exploring alternative revenue streams, such as energy storage solutions or consultancy services, can further bolster the company's financial position.

7. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with regulatory bodies proactively to stay ahead of potential regulatory changes. This proactive approach can help in better preparation and can also influence regulations in a manner favorable to Energix.

8. **Market Research & Consumer Insights**: Conduct regular market research to understand consumer preferences, especially concerning renewable energy. This can guide Energix's strategy in terms of energy source diversification and pricing.
